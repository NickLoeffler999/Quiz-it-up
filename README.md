# Quiz it Up!

Welcome to Quiz it Up! This coding quiz is specifically designed for students who are new to learning full-stack web development. It's a great way to test your knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

Quiz it Up! is an interactive web application that allows you to challenge yourself and improve your understanding of key concepts in web development. Whether you're a bootcamp student or simply interested in learning more about coding, this quiz provides an engaging experience to enhance your skills.

I created this application not only for others but also for myself. It serves as a platform where I can continually add new questions and even create multiple sections with different themes or difficulty levels in the future. Developing this project was an exciting journey that put my abilities to the test, and I'm thrilled to finally share it with you!
